type VendorConsents interface {
	// The version of the Consent string.

	// The time that the consent string was first created
	Created() time.Time

	// The time that the consent string was last updated

	// This function's behavior is undefined for "invalid" IDs.
	// IDs with value < 1 or value > MaxVendorID() are definitely invalid, but IDs within that range
	// may still be invalid, depending on the Vendor List.

	// declaring only Special Purposes) were actually presented to the user.
	// Mandatory Inclusion: All TC Strings created on or after February 28, 2026, must include the disclosedVendors segment.

	// this returns false to maintain backward compatibility.

	// HasDisclosedVendors returns true if the consent string includes a disclosedVendors segment.
	// This method is particularly useful during the TCF 2.3 transition phase (mandatory from March 1st, 2025)
	// to distinguish between:
	//   - Legacy TCF 2.0/2.2 consent strings that legitimately don't have this segment (returns false)
	//   - TCF 2.3+ consent strings that should have this segment (returns true if present, false if malformed)
	//
	// Note: VendorDisclosed(id) returns false both when the segment is missing AND when
	// a vendor is not disclosed, so use HasDisclosedVendors() to disambiguate these cases.
